 20    report,  the  school  in  which the child is currently enrolled shall flag the
 21    record of that child in such a manner that whenever a copy of  or  information
 22    regarding  the  record  is  requested, the school shall be alerted to the fact

  9    school that the transferred student's records are being held for nonpayment of
 10    tuition  or fees. However, such private school shall be required to notify the
 11    local law enforcement agency if the student's record has been flagged pursuant
 12    to the provisions of subsection (1) of this section,  even  if  the  student's
 13    tuition and fees have not been paid.

 15    ately investigate each report received from a school of a  failure  to  comply
 16    with the provisions of subsection (2) or subsection (3) of this section.
 17        (5.)  Failure  of  a  parent, or person in custody of a child, or a person
 18    enrolling a student, to comply with the  documentation  requirements  of  this
 19    section  after  a  lawful request by a law enforcement agency, or to cooperate

  1    stances is requested, the person shall be informed that if the person  refuses
  2    to  submit  to or fails to complete evidentiary testing, or if the person sub-
  3    mits to and completes evidentiary testing and the  test  results  indicate  an
  4    alcohol  concentration  or  the  presence  of drugs or other intoxicating sub-
  5    stances in violation of section 18-8004, 18-8004C or 18-8006, Idaho Code,  the
  6    person  shall  be  informed substantially as follows (but need not be informed
  7    verbatim):
  8        If you refuse to submit to or if you fail to complete and pass evidentiary
  9    testing for alcohol or other intoxicating substances:
 10        (a)  The peace officer will seize your driver's license and issue a notice
 11        of suspension and a temporary driving permit to you, but no peace  officer
 12        will issue you a temporary driving permit if your driver's license or per-
 13        mit  has  already been and is suspended or revoked. No peace officer shall
 14        issue a temporary driving permit to a driver of a commercial  vehicle  who
 15        refuses to submit to or fails to complete and pass an evidentiary test;
 16        (b)  You  have the right to request a hearing within seven (7) days of the
 17        notice of suspension of your  driver's  license  to  show  cause  why  you
 18        refused  to  submit to or to complete and pass evidentiary testing and why
 19        your driver's license should not be suspended;
 20        (c)  If you refused or failed to complete evidentiary testing and  do  not
 21        request  a hearing before the court or do not prevail at the hearing, your
 22        driver's license will be suspended. The suspension will be for one hundred
 23        eighty (180) days if this is your first refusal. The  suspension  will  be
 24        for one (1) year if this is your second refusal within five (5) years. You
 25        will  not  be  able  to  obtain a temporary restricted license during that
 26        period; and
 27        (d)  If you complete evidentiary testing and fail the testing and  do  not
 28        request  a hearing before the department or do not prevail at the hearing,
 29        your driver's license will be  suspended.  This  suspension  will  be  for
 30        ninety (90) days if this is your first failure of evidentiary testing, but
 31        you may request  restricted driving privileges after the first thirty (30)
 32        days. The suspension will be for one (1) year if this is your second fail-
 33        ure  of evidentiary testing within five (5) years. You will not be able to
 34        obtain a temporary restricted license during that period;
 35        (e)  After submitting to evidentiary testing you may, when practicable, at
 36        your own expense, have additional tests made  by  a  person  of  your  own
 37        choosing.
 38        (3)  Rulemaking authority of the department of law enforcement Idaho state
 39    police.  The Idaho department of law enforcement state police may, pursuant to
 40    chapter 52, title 67, Idaho Code, prescribe by rule:
 41        (a)  What testing is required to complete evidentiary testing  under  this
 42        section; and
 43        (b)  What  calibration  or checking of testing equipment must be performed
 44        to comply with the department's  requirements.  Any  rules  of  the  Idaho
 45        department of law enforcement state police shall be in accordance with the
 46        following:  a  test for alcohol concentration in breath as defined in sec-
 47        tion 18-8004, Idaho Code, and subsection (1)(e) of this  section  will  be
 48        valid  for  the  purposes  of  this  section if the breath alcohol testing
 49        instrument was approved  for  testing  by  the  Idaho  department  of  law
 50        enforcement  state  police in accordance with section 18-8004, Idaho Code,
 51        at any time within ninety (90) days before the evidentiary testing. A test
 52        for alcohol concentration in blood or urine as defined in section 18-8004,
 53        Idaho Code, that is reported by the Idaho department  of  law  enforcement
 54        state  police or by any laboratory approved by the Idaho department of law
 55        enforcement state police to perform this test will be valid for  the  pur-

  5        physical  control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
  6        drugs or other intoxicating substances and that the person submitted to  a
  7        test  and the test results indicated an alcohol concentration or the pres-
  8        ence of drugs or other intoxicating substances  in  violation  of  section
  9        18-8004, 18-8004C or 18-8006, Idaho Code, the department shall suspend the

 14             (30)  days  of  the suspension shall be absolute and the person shall
 15             have absolutely no driving privileges of any kind.  Restricted  driv-
 16             ing privileges applicable during the remaining sixty (60) days of the
 17             suspension  may  be  requested  as provided in subsection (9) of this
 18             section.
 19             (ii)  For a period of one (1) year for a second  and  any  subsequent
 20             failure  of  evidentiary testing under the provisions of this section

 22             leges of any kind shall be granted during the suspension imposed pur-
 23             suant to this subsection.
 24        The person may request an administrative hearing on the suspension as pro-
 25        vided  in subsection (7) of this section. Any right to contest the suspen-
 26        sion shall be waived if a hearing is not requested as therein provided.
 27        (b)  The suspension shall become effective thirty (30) days after  service
 28        upon the person of the notice of suspension. The notice shall be in a form
 29        provided by the department and shall state:

 41             (vii) The right to judicial review of the hearing officer's  decision
 42             on the suspension and the procedures for seeking such review.
 43        (5)  Service  of  suspension  by  peace  officer or the department. If the
 44    driver submits to evidentiary testing after the information in subsection  (2)
 45    of  this  section  has  been  provided and the results of the test indicate an
 46    alcohol concentration or the presence of  drugs  or  other  intoxicating  sub-
 47    stances  in  violation  of  the  provisions  of  section  18-8004, 18-8004C or
 48    18-8006, Idaho Code:
 49        (a)  The peace officer shall take  possession  of  the  person's  driver's
 50        license,  shall issue a temporary permit which shall be valid for a period
 51        not to exceed thirty (30) days from the date of issuance, and,  acting  on
 52        behalf  of  the department, will serve the person with a notice of suspen-
 53        sion in the form and containing the information required under  subsection
 54        (4)  of this section. The department may serve the person with a notice of
 55        suspension if the peace officer failed to issue the notice  of  suspension

                                           31

  1        or  failed to include the date of service as provided in subsection (4)(b)
  2        of this section.
  3        (b)  Within five (5) business days following service of a notice  of  sus-
  4        pension  the  peace  officer shall forward to the department a copy of the
  5        completed notice of suspension form upon which the date  of  service  upon
  6        the  driver  shall be clearly indicated, a copy of any completed temporary
  7        permit form along with any  confiscated  driver's  license,  and  a  sworn
  8        statement  of  the  officer,  which may incorporate any arrest or incident
  9        reports relevant to the arrest and evidentiary testing setting forth:
 10             (i)   The identity of the person;
 11             (ii)  Stating the officer's legal cause to stop the person;
 12             (iii) Stating the officer's legal cause to believe  that  the  person
 13             had been driving or was in actual physical control of a motor vehicle
 14             while  under  the  influence  of alcohol, drugs or other intoxicating
 15             substances  in  violation  of  the  provisions  of  section  18-8004,
 16             18-8004C or 18-8006, Idaho Code;
 17             (iv)  That the person was advised of the consequences of  taking  and
 18             failing  the  evidentiary  test as provided in subsection (2) of this
 19             section;
 20             (v)   That the person was lawfully arrested;
 21             (vi)  That the person was tested for alcohol concentration, drugs  or
 22             other  intoxicating  substances as provided in this chapter, and that
 23             the results of the test indicated an  alcohol  concentration  or  the
 24             presence  of  drugs  or other intoxicating substances in violation of
 25             the provisions of section 18-8004, 18-8004C or 18-8006, Idaho Code.
 26    A certified copy or duplicate original of the results of all tests for alcohol
 27    concentration, as shown by analysis of breath administered at the direction of
 28    the peace officer shall accompany the sworn statement of the  officer.  If  an
 29    evidentiary test of blood or urine was administered rather than a breath test,
 30    the  peace officer or the department shall serve the notice of suspension once
 31    the results are received. The sworn  statement  required  in  this  subsection
 32    shall be made on forms in accordance with rules adopted by the department.
 33        (c)  The  department  may  serve the person with a notice of suspension if
 34        the peace officer failed to issue the notice of suspension  or  failed  to
 35        include  the date of service as provided in subsection (4)(b) of this sec-
 36        tion.
 37        (6)  Additional tests. After submitting  to  evidentiary  testing  at  the
 38    request  of  the  peace  officer, the person may, when practicable, at his own
 39    expense, have additional tests for alcohol concentration or for  the  presence
 40    of  drugs  or other intoxicating substances made by a person of his own choos-
 41    ing. The person's failure or inability to obtain additional  tests  shall  not
 42    preclude  admission  of  the  results of evidentiary tests administered at the
 43    direction of the peace officer unless additional testing  was  denied  by  the
 44    peace officer.
 45        (7)  Administrative  hearing  on  suspension. A person who has been served
 46    with a notice of suspension  after  submitting  to  an  evidentiary  test  may
 47    request  an  administrative hearing on the suspension before a hearing officer
 48    designated by the department. The request for hearing shall be in writing  and
 49    must be received by the department within seven (7) calendar  days of the date
 50    of service upon the person of the notice of suspension, and shall include what
 51    issue  or issues shall be raised at the hearing. The date on which the hearing
 52    request was received shall be noted on the face of the request.
 53        If a hearing is requested, the hearing shall be held  within  twenty  (20)
 54    days  of  the  date  the hearing request was received by the department unless
 55    this period is, for good cause shown, extended by the hearing officer for  one

                                           32

  1    ten (10) day period. Such extension shall not operate as a stay of the suspen-
  2    sion  and  any temporary permit shall expire thirty (30) days after service of
  3    the notice of suspension, notwithstanding an extension  of  the  hearing  date
  4    beyond such thirty (30) day period. Written notice of the date and time of the
  5    hearing  shall  be sent to the party requesting the hearing at least seven (7)
  6    days prior to the scheduled hearing date. The department may conduct all hear-
  7    ings by telephone if each participant in the hearing  has  an  opportunity  to
  8    participate in the entire proceeding while it is taking place.
  9        The  hearing shall be recorded. The sworn statement of the arresting offi-
 10    cer, and the copy of the notice of suspension and any temporary permit  issued
 11    by  the officer shall be admissible at the hearing without further evidentiary
 12    foundation. The results of any tests for alcohol concentration or the presence
 13    of drugs or other intoxicating substances  by  analysis  of  blood,  urine  or
 14    breath  administered  at  the  direction  of the peace officer and the records
 15    relating to calibration, certification, approval or quality control pertaining
 16    to equipment utilized to perform the tests shall be admissible as provided  in
 17    section 18-8004(4), Idaho Code. The arresting officer shall not be required to
 18    participate unless directed to do so by a subpoena issued by the hearing offi-
 19    cer.
 20        The  burden  of  proof  shall be on the person requesting the hearing. The
 21    hearing officer shall not vacate the suspension unless he finds, by a  prepon-
 22    derance of the evidence, that:
 23        (a)  The peace officer did not have legal cause to stop the person; or
 24        (b)  The  officer  did not have legal cause to believe the person had been
 25        driving or was in actual physical control of a  vehicle  while  under  the
 26        influence  of alcohol, drugs or other intoxicating substances in violation
 27        of the provisions of section 18-8004, 18-8004C or 18-8006, Idaho Code; or
 28        (c)  The test results did not show an alcohol concentration or  the  pres-
 29        ence  of  drugs  or  other intoxicating substances in violation of section
 30        18-8004, 18-8004C or 18-8006, Idaho Code; or
 31        (d)  The tests for alcohol concentration, drugs or other intoxicating sub-
 32        stances administered at the direction of the peace officer were  not  con-
 33        ducted  in  accordance  with the requirements of section 18-8004(4), Idaho
 34        Code, or the testing equipment was not functioning properly when the  test
 35        was administered; or
 36        (e)  The person was not informed of the consequences of submitting to evi-
 37        dentiary testing as required in subsection (2) of this section.
 38    If  the hearing officer finds that the person has not met his burden of proof,
 39    he shall sustain the suspension. The hearing officer shall  make  findings  of
 40    fact and conclusions of law on each issue and shall enter an order vacating or
 41    sustaining the suspension. If the suspension is vacated, the person's driver's
 42    license,  unless  unavailable by reason of an existing suspension, revocation,
 43    cancellation, disqualification or denial shall be returned to him.  The  find-
 44    ings  of  fact,  conclusions  of  law and order entered by the hearing officer
 45    shall be considered a final order pursuant to the provisions  of  chapter  52,
 46    title  67,  Idaho  Code, except that motions for reconsideration of such order
 47    shall be allowed and new evidence can be submitted.
 48        The facts as found by the hearing officer  shall  be  independent  of  the
 49    determination of the same or similar facts in the adjudication of any criminal
 50    charges  arising out of the same occurrence. The disposition of those criminal
 51    charges shall not affect the suspension required to be imposed under the  pro-
 52    visions  of this section. If a license is suspended under this section and the
 53    person is also convicted on criminal charges arising out of  the  same  occur-
 54    rence  for  a  violation  of  the  provisions  of section 18-8004, 18-8004C or
 55    18-8006, Idaho Code, both the suspension under this section and the suspension

                                           33

  1    imposed pursuant to the provisions of section 18-8005 or 18-8006, Idaho  Code,
  2    shall  be  imposed, but the periods of suspension shall run concurrently, with
  3    the total period of suspension not to exceed the longer of the applicable sus-
  4    pension periods, unless the court ordering the suspension in the criminal case
  5    orders to the contrary.
  6        (8)  Judicial review. A party aggrieved by the  decision  of  the  hearing
  7    officer  may  seek  judicial review of the decision in the manner provided for
  8    judicial review of final agency action provided in chapter 52, title 67, Idaho
  9    Code.
 10        (9)  Restricted driving privileges. A person served with a notice of  sus-
 11    pension for ninety (90) days pursuant to this section may apply to the depart-
 12    ment  for  restricted driving privileges, to become effective after the thirty
 13    (30) day absolute suspension has been completed. The request may  be  made  at
 14    any  time after service of the notice of suspension. Restricted driving privi-
 15    leges will be issued for the person to travel to and from work  and  for  work
 16    purposes,  to  attend  an  alternative  high  school, work on a GED, for post-
 17    secondary education, or to meet the medical needs of the person or his  family
 18    if the person is eligible for restricted driving privileges.
 19        (10) Rules. The department may adopt rules under the provisions of chapter
 20    52, title 67, Idaho Code, deemed necessary to implement the provisions of this

 39    fact that any person charged with a violation of the provisions of  this  sub-
 40    section  is or has been entitled to use such drug under the laws of this state
 41    shall not constitute a defense against any charge of a violation of the provi-

 43        (6)  "Actual physical control" as used in this section, shall  be  defined
 44    as  being in the driver's position of the motor vehicle with the motor running

 26        ing  and  verifying  that  at  least sixty (60) days have passed since the
 27        defendant has notified the prosecuting attorney and the bureau of forensic
 28        services of the expungement request and that the court  finds  no  reason,
 29        based on the interests of justice, to deny expungement.
 30        (4)  Upon  order  of  the  court,  the department of law enforcement Idaho
 31    state police shall destroy the DNA sample relating to the subject  of  convic-
 32    tion, unless the department state police determines that the person has other-

 27    juvenile until the juvenile can be delivered forthwith into the custody  of  a
 28    peace officer, without order of the court:
 29        (a)  When he has reasonable cause to believe that the juvenile has commit-
 30        ted  an  act  which  would  be  a misdemeanor or felony if committed by an
 31        adult; or
 32        (b)  When in the presence of a peace officer or private citizen the  juve-
 33        nile  has violated any local, state or federal law or municipal ordinance;
 34        or
 35        (c)  When there are reasonable grounds to believe the juvenile has commit-
 36        ted a status offense. Status offenses are truancy, running  away  from  or
 37        being beyond the control of parents, guardian, or legal custodian and cur-
 38        few  violations. Status offenders shall not be placed in any jail facility
 39        but instead may be placed in juvenile shelter care facilities,  except  in

 50    possible. Unless otherwise ordered by the court, or unless it appears  to  the
 51    officer taking the juvenile into custody that it is contrary to the welfare of
 52    society or the juvenile, such juvenile shall be released to the custody of his
 53    parent or other responsible adult upon written promise, signed by such person,

                                           50

  2    shall be submitted to the court as soon as possible. If such person shall fail
  3    to produce the juvenile as agreed, or upon notice from the  court,  a  summons
  4    for  such  person  may  be issued by the court and a warrant may be issued for
  5    apprehension of the juvenile.
  6        (3)  A juvenile taken into custody may be fingerprinted and  photographed.
  7    Any  fingerprints and photographs taken shall be forwarded as provided in sub-
  8    section (8) of this section. If the court finds good cause it  may  order  any
  9    fingerprints and photographs expunged.
 10        (4)  When  a  juvenile  is not released he shall be taken forthwith to the
 11    court or place of detention specified by the court and  then  not  later  than
 12    twenty-four  (24)  hours,  excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, shall be
 13    brought before the court for a detention hearing to determine where the  juve-
 14    nile  will  be  placed  until  the next hearing. Status offenders shall not be
 15    placed in any jail facility, but instead may be  placed  in  juvenile  shelter
 16    care facilities.
 17        Placements may include, but are not limited to, the following:
 18        (a)  Parents of the juvenile;
 19        (b)  Relatives of the juvenile;
 20        (c)  Foster care;

 25    notice to the court that the juvenile is in his custody.
 26        (6)  No juvenile shall be held in detention longer than  twenty-four  (24)
 27    hours,  exclusive  of  Saturdays,  Sundays and holidays, unless a petition has
 28    been filed and the court has signed the detention order.
 29        (7)  As soon as a juvenile is detained by court order, his parents, guard-
 30    ian or legal custodian shall be informed by notice in writing  on  forms  pre-
 31    scribed  by the court that they may have a prompt hearing regarding release or
 32    detention.
 33        (8)  A juvenile taken into detention for an offense shall be fingerprinted
 34    and photographed. Fingerprints and photographs taken  of  juveniles  shall  be
 35    forwarded  to the appropriate law enforcement agency and filed with the bureau
 36    of criminal identification of the Idaho department of  law  enforcement  state
 37    police  which  shall  create a juvenile fingerprint file and enter the finger-
 38    print data into the automated fingerprint identification system.  The  finger-
 39    print  data  shall  then  be forwarded to the department to be maintained in a
 40    statewide juvenile offender information system. Access to the  information  in
 41    the juvenile offender system shall be controlled by the department, subject to
 42    the  provisions of section 9-342, Idaho Code. If the court finds good cause it
 43    may order the fingerprints and photographs of the juvenile expunged.
 44        (9)  Peace officers' records of juveniles  shall  be  kept  separate  from
 45    records  of  adults and shall be subject to disclosure according to chapter 3,
 46    title 9, Idaho Code.

 52    whether upon an airport or body of water, or in the airspace over this state:
 53        (a)  Within eight (8) hours after the consumption of any alcoholic  bever-

                                           51

  1        age;
  2        (b)  While under the influence of alcohol;
  3        (c)  While  using  any drug that affects the person's faculties in any way
  4        contrary to safety; or
  5        (d)  While having an alcohol concentration of 0.04 as defined  in  subsec-
  6        tion  (5)  of  this  section,  or more, as shown by analysis of his blood,
  7        urine, or breath.
  8        (2)  Any person having an alcohol  concentration  of  less  than  0.04  as
  9    defined  in subsection (5) of this section, as shown by analysis of his blood,
 10    urine, breath, or other bodily substance, by a test requested by an authorized
 11    law enforcement officer shall not be  prosecuted  for  operating  an  aircraft
 12    while  under the influence of alcohol, except as provided in subsection (3) of
 13    this section. Any person who does not take a test to determine alcohol concen-
 14    tration or whose test result is determined by the court to  be  unreliable  or
 15    inadmissible  against  him,  may be prosecuted for piloting or being in actual
 16    physical control of an aircraft while under the influence of  alcohol,  drugs,
 17    or  any  other  intoxication  intoxicating substances, on other competent evi-
 18    dence.
 19        (3)  If the results of the test requested by an authorized law enforcement
 20    officer show a person's alcohol concentration of less than 0.04, as defined in
 21    subsection (5) of this section, such fact may be considered with other  compe-
 22    tent evidence of drug use other than alcohol in determining the guilt or inno-
 23    cence of the defendant.
 24        (4)  Persons  authorized to withdraw blood for the purposes of determining
 25    content of alcohol or other intoxicating substances are those  persons  autho-
 26    rized in section 18-8003, Idaho Code.
 27        (5)  For purposes of this chapter, an evidentiary test for alcohol concen-
 28    tration  is  a  determination  of the per cent percent by weight of alcohol in
 29    blood and shall be based upon a formula of grams of alcohol  per  one  hundred
 30    (100)  cubic  centimeters of blood, per two hundred ten (210) liters of breath
 31    or sixty-seven (67) milliliters of urine. Analysis of blood, urine  or  breath
 32    for  the  purpose of determining the blood alcohol concentration shall be per-
 33    formed by a laboratory operated by the Idaho  department  of  law  enforcement
 34    state  police  or  by  a  laboratory  approved  by the Idaho department of law
 35    enforcement state police under the provisions of  approval  and  certification
 36    standards to be set by that department, or by any other method approved by the
 37    Idaho  department  of  law enforcement state police. Notwithstanding any other
 38    provision of law or rule of court, the results of any test for alcohol concen-
 39    tration and records relating to calibration, approval, certification or  qual-
 40    ity  control  performed  by  a  laboratory  operated  or approved by the Idaho
 41    department of law enforcement state police or by any other method approved  by
 42    the  Idaho  department  of law enforcement state police shall be admissible in

 34             dence  upon the fact of the unlawful use, or intent to use, and shall
 35             order the property forfeited to the director, or  appropriate  prose-
 36             cuting attorney, if such fact is proved.
 37             (D)  If  a  verified answer is filed, the forfeiture proceeding shall
 38             be set for hearing before the court without a jury on a day not  less
 39             than thirty (30) days therefrom; and the proceeding shall have prior-
 40             ity over other civil cases.
 41                  (I)   At the hearing any owner who has a verified answer on file
 42                  may  show by competent evidence that the conveyance was not used
 43                  or intended to be used in any  manner  described  in  subsection
 44                  (a)(4) of this section.
 45                  (II)  At the hearing any owner who has a verified answer on file
 46                  may  show by competent evidence that his interest in the convey-
 47                  ance is not subject to forfeiture  because  he  could  not  have
 48                  known  in  the exercise of reasonable diligence that the convey-
 49                  ance was being used, had been used, was intended to be  used  or
 50                  had  been intended to be used in any manner described in subsec-
 51                  tion (a)(4) of this section.
 52                  (III) If the court finds that the property was not used  or  was
 53                  not intended to be used in violation of this act, or is not sub-
 54                  ject  to  forfeiture  under  this act, the court shall order the
 55                  property released to the owner as his right, title, or  interest

                                           81

  1                  appears  on records in the appropriate department as of the sei-
  2                  zure.
  3                  (IV)  An owner, co-owner or claimant of  any  right,  title,  or
  4                  interest  in  the conveyance may prove that his right, title, or
  5                  interest, whether under a lien, mortgage, conditional sales con-
  6                  tract or otherwise, was created without any knowledge or  reason
  7                  to  believe  that  the conveyance was being used, had been used,
  8                  was intended to be used, or had been intended to be used for the
  9                  purpose alleged;
 10                       (i)   In the event of such proof, the court shall order the
 11                       conveyance released to the bona  fide  or  innocent  owner,
 12                       purchaser,  lienholder,  mortgagee,  or  conditional  sales
 13                       vendor.  The  court may order payment of all costs incurred
 14                       by the state or law enforcement agency as a result of  such
 15                       seizure.
 16                       (ii)  If  the  amount  due  to such person is less than the
 17                       value of the conveyance, the conveyance may be sold at pub-
 18                       lic auction by  the  director  or  appropriate  prosecuting
 19                       attorney.  The  director, or appropriate prosecuting attor-

 21                       publication in a newspaper published and circulated in  the

 23                       at  least one (1) week prior to sale of the conveyance. The
 24                       proceeds from such sale shall be distributed as follows  in
 25                       the order indicated;

 32        the property described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of this
 33        section shall cause a written inventory to be made and maintain custody of
 34        the same until all legal actions have been exhausted unless such  property
 35        has  been  placed  in  lawful  custody  of a court or state or federal law
 36        enforcement agency. After all  legal  actions  have  been  exhausted  with
 37        respect  to such property, the property shall be surrendered by the court,

 49        of destruction shall be kept on  file  at  the  office  of  the  director.
 50        Except,  however,  that  the director of the department of law enforcement
 51        Idaho state police or his designee may authorize the destruction  of  drug
 52        or  nondrug  evidence, or store those items at government expense when, in
 53        the opinion of the director or his  designee,  it  is  not  reasonable  to
 54        remove  or  transport  such  items  from  the  location of the seizure for
 55        destruction. In such case, a representative sample  will  be  removed  and

                                           83

  1        preserved  for  evidentiary  purposes  and, when practicable, destroyed as

 10        (h)  The  failure,  upon  demand  by  the director, or his duly authorized
 11    agent, of the person in occupancy or in control of land or premises upon which
 12    the species of plants are growing or being stored, to produce  an  appropriate
 13    registration,  or  proof  that he is the holder thereof, constitutes authority
 14    for the seizure and forfeiture of the plants.
 15        (i)  The director shall have the authority to enter upon any land or  into
 16    any  dwelling  pursuant  to  a  search  warrant, to cut, harvest, carry off or
 17    destroy such plants described in subsection (g) hereof.

 13                       equivalent.
 14                  3.  Notwithstanding any other provision of  this  section,  upon
 15                  being  satisfied  that  the  interest  of a co-owner or claimant
 16                  should not be subject to forfeiture because  they  neither  knew
 17                  nor  should have known that the personal property was being used
 18                  or had been used for the purposes alleged, or that due to preex-
 19                  isting security interests in such property there  is  no  equity
 20                  which  may  be  forfeited,  the  attorney general or appropriate
 21                  prosecuting attorney may release the property to  the  co-owner,
 22                  holder of the security interest, or other claimant.
 23                  4.  In  any case, the attorney general, or appropriate prosecut-
 24                  ing attorney, may, within thirty (30) days after order  of  for-
 25                  feiture,  pay the balance due to the bona fide lienholder, mort-

 28        SECTION  93.  That Section 37-2808, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby
 29    amended to read as follows:

 30        37-2808.  REAL PROPERTY -- RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES. (1) Real property sub-
 31    ject to forfeiture under the provisions of this chapter may be seized  by  the
 32    attorney  general  or appropriate prosecuting attorney upon determining that a
 33    parcel of property is subject to forfeiture, by filing  a  notice  of  seizure
 34    with  the  recorder of the county in which the property or any part thereof is
 35    situated. The notice must contain a legal description of the  property  sought
 36    to be forfeited; provided however, that in the event the property sought to be
 37    forfeited  is  part  of  a greater parcel, the attorney general or appropriate
 38    prosecuting attorney may, for the purposes  of  this  notice,  use  the  legal
 39    description  of the greater parcel. The attorney general or appropriate prose-
 40    cuting attorney shall also send by certified mail a copy of the notice of sei-
 41    zure to any persons holding a recorded  interest  or  of  whose  interest  the
 42    attorney general or appropriate prosecuting attorney has actual knowledge. The
 43    attorney general or appropriate prosecuting attorney shall post a similar copy
 44    of  the notice conspicuously upon the property and publish a copy thereof once
 45    a week for three (3) consecutive weeks immediately following the seizure in  a
 46    newspaper  published in the county. The co-owner or party in lawful possession
 47    of the property sought to be forfeited may retain possession and  use  thereof
 48    and  may  collect  and keep income from the property while the forfeiture pro-
 49    ceedings are pending.
 50        (2)  In the event of a seizure pursuant to subsection (1) of this section,
 51    a request for forfeiture shall be filed with the trial court within  the  time
 52    limit  imposed  by section 37-2804, Idaho Code. The request shall be served in
 53    the same manner as complaints subject to the Idaho rules of civil procedure on

                                           86

  1    all persons having an interest in the real property sought to be forfeited.
  2        (3)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, upon being  sat-
  3    isfied  that  the  interest of a co-owner or claimant should not be subject to
  4    forfeiture because they neither knew nor should have known that the real prop-
  5    erty was being used or had been used for the purposes alleged, or that due  to
  6    preexisting  security  interests in such property there is no equity which may
  7    be forfeited, the attorney general or  appropriate  prosecuting  attorney  may
  8    release  the  property  to  the  co-owner, holder of the security interest, or
  9    other claimant.
 10        (4)  Within twenty (20) days of the mailing of the notice, the co-owner or
 11    party in interest may file  a  verified  answer  and  claim  to  the  property
 12    described in the notice.
 13        (5)  If  a  verified answer is filed within twenty (20) days after mailing
 14    of the notice, the forfeiture proceeding against all co-owners and parties  in
 15    interest  who  have filed verified answers shall be set for hearing before the
 16    court without a jury on a day not less than sixty (60) days after the  mailing
 17    of the notice; and the proceeding shall have priority over other civil cases.
 18        (a)  A  co-owner,  or claimant of any right, title or interest in the real
 19        property sought to be forfeited may prove that his right, title or  inter-
 20        est,  whether under a lien, mortgage, deed of trust or otherwise, was cre-
 21        ated without any knowledge or reason to believe that the real property was
 22        being used or had been used for the purposes alleged;
 23        (b)  Any co-owner who has a verified answer on file may show by  competent
 24        evidence  that  his interest in the property sought to be forfeited is not
 25        subject to forfeiture because he could not have known in the  exercise  of
 26        reasonable  diligence  that  the real property was being used, or had been
 27        used in any manner in violation of  the  provisions  of  section  37-2801,
 28        Idaho Code.
 29        (6)  In  the event of such proof, the court shall order the release of the
 30    interest of the co-owner, purchaser, lienholder, mortgagee or beneficiary.
 31        (a)  If the amount due to such person is less than the value of  the  real
 32        property,  the real property may be sold in a commercially reasonable man-
 33        ner by the attorney general or appropriate prosecuting attorney. The  pro-
 34        ceeds  from  such  sale shall be distributed as follows in the order indi-
 35        cated:
 36             (i)  To the innocent co-owner, purchaser, mortgagee or beneficiary of
 37             the real property, if any, up to the value of  his  interest  in  the
 38             real property.
 39             (ii) The balance, if any, in the following order:
 40                  1.  To  the attorney general or appropriate prosecuting attorney
 41                  for all expenditures made or incurred  in  connection  with  the
 42                  sale, including expenditure for any necessary repairs or mainte-
 43                  nance  of  the  real  property, and for all expenditures made or
 44                  incurred in connection with the forfeiture  proceedings  includ-
 45                  ing,  but  not  limited  to,  expenditures  for witnesses' fees,
 46                  reporters' fees, transcripts, printing,  travel,  investigation,
 47                  title company fees and insurance premiums.
 48                  2.  The  remainder,  if  any, to the director of law enforcement
 49                  the Idaho state police for credit to the drug enforcement  dona-
 50                  tion account fund created in section 57-816, Idaho Code.
 51        (b)  In any case, the attorney general or appropriate prosecuting attorney
 52        may,  within  thirty (30) days after the order of forfeiture, pay the bal-
 53        ance due to the innocent co-owner,  purchaser,  lienholder,  mortgagee  or
 54        beneficiary and thereby purchase the real property for use in the enforce-
 55        ment of this chapter.

 49    elected  officials of an incorporated city have established speed limits lower
 50    than those set by the department on the portion of state  highways,  excluding
 51    controlled-access  and  interstate  highways,  that  pass through residential,
 52    urban or business districts within the jurisdiction of the incorporated  city.

  4    speed otherwise permissible under this title, shall determine and declare  the
  5    maximum  speed of vehicles which the structure can safely withstand, and shall
  6    cause or permit suitable signs stating the maximum speed  to  be  erected  and
  7    maintained before each end of the structure.

 11    may determine and declare a minimum speed limit below which  no  person  shall
 12    drive a vehicle except when necessary for safe operation or in compliance with
 13    law,  and  that limit shall be effective when posted upon appropriate fixed or
 14    variable signs, except in cases where the duly elected officials of an  incor-
 15    porated  city  have  established  speed  limits  lower   than those set by the
 16    department on portions of  state  highways,  excluding  controlled-access  and

 26    place and maintain stop signs, directing  vehicular  traffic  approaching  the
 27    crossing to come to a full stop prior to entering the crossing at all railroad
 28    crossings where electric or mechanical warning signals do not exist. Placement
 29    of  these  stop  signs  shall be mandatory except when in the determination of
 30    public highway agencies the existence of stop signs at a given crossing  would
 31    constitute a greater hazard than their absence based on a recognized engineer-
 32    ing study.
 33        Nothing  in this subsection shall be construed as granting immunity to any
 34    railroad  company as to liability, if any, for an accident which  might  occur
 35    at  a  crossing  where  stop signs are erected and in place, but liability, if
 36    any, shall be determined as provided by law. Liability on the part of  govern-
 37    mental  authorities on account of absence of any stop sign at a crossing shall
 38    be determined as provided by law.

 42    cially hazardous and may by appropriate signs or markings on the roadway indi-
 43    cate the beginning and end of those  zones and when signs or markings  are  in
 44    place  and clearly visible to an ordinarily observant  person, every driver of
 45    a vehicle shall obey those directions.
 46        (27) The department and local authorities in  their  respective  jurisdic-
 47    tions may in their discretion issue special permits authorizing the  operation
 48    upon  a  highway  of  traction  engines or tractors having movable tracks with
 49    transverse corrugations upon the periphery of the movable tracks or farm trac-
 50    tors or other farm machinery, the operation of  which  upon  a  highway  would
 51    otherwise be prohibited under this title or title 40, Idaho Code.
 52        (28) The  department and local highway authorities within their respective
 53    jurisdictions may place official traffic-control devices prohibiting, limiting
 54    or restricting the stopping, standing or parking of vehicles  on  any  highway
 55    where such stopping, standing or parking is dangerous to those using the high-

                                           111

  1    way  or  where the stopping, standing or parking of vehicles unduly interferes
  2    with the free movement of traffic thereon.

  6    driver's license test, the department shall include material about the state's
  7    open  range  law  and responsibilities, liabilities and obligations of drivers

  6        means principal duties which:
  7             (i)   Will reasonably expect to increase  the  probability  of  early

 15        (b)  If continued employment in a position is conditioned  on  maintaining
 16        current POST certification, such condition shall be evidence to be consid-
 17        ered that the employee is a police officer member for retirement purposes.
 18             (i)   After  July  1,  1999, a requirement for POST certification for
 19             classified state employees may be made only by the  administrator  of
 20             the  division  of  human  resources pursuant to chapter 53, title 67,

 22        (c)  Occasional assignments to hazardous law  enforcement  duties  do  not
 23        create  a condition for designation as a police officer member for retire-

 26    cally  designated  as  a police officer by law, is incorrectly classified as a
 27    nonpolice officer member, may petition the retirement board for  inclusion  of
 28    that  employee's  position  as one to be filled by a police officer member for
 29    retirement purposes. The petition shall be in writing  and  shall  explain  in
 30    detail the principal duties of the position and include written evidence which
 31    establishes  that  the  criteria  of  subsection  (4) are met. The board shall
 32    review the petition and evidence, together with such information and  evidence
 33    as  may  be  presented  by  the  staff of the retirement system. The board may
 34    decide the matter based upon the information supplied, may request  additional
 35    information,  or  may request an oral presentation before the board. The deci-
 36    sion of the board shall be final, but a similar petition  may  be  resubmitted
 37    after six (6) months.
 38        (6)  On  and after July 1, 1985, no active member shall be classified as a
 39    police officer for retirement purposes unless the employer shall  have  certi-
 40    fied  to  the  board,  on a form provided by the board, that such member is an
 41    employee whose primary position with the employer is one  designated  as  such
 42    within  the  meaning  of  this chapter, and the board shall have accepted such
 43    certification. Acceptance by the board of an employer's certification shall in
 44    no way limit the board's right to  review  and  reclassify  the  position  for
 45    retirement  purposes  based  upon  an audit or other relevant information pre-
 46    sented to the board.
 47        (7)  An active member classified as a police officer for  retirement  pur-
 48    poses  whose  position is reclassified to that of a general member for retire-
 49    ment purposes as a result  of a determination that the position does not  meet
 50    the requirements of this chapter for police officer status for retirement pur-
 51    poses  shall  become  a  general member but shall not lose retirement benefits
 52    earned and accrued prior to the reclassification. If that member continues  to
 53    be  employed  in  that  same  position until retired, that member then will be
 54    deemed to be a police officer member for the purposes of retirement  eligibil-
 55    ity.

 43    ment  state  police or by any other method approved by the Idaho department of
 44    law enforcement state police shall be admissible in  any  proceeding  in  this
 45    state  without the necessity of producing a witness to establish the reliabil-
 46    ity of the testing procedure for examination.

 48    the influence of any narcotic drug, or who is under the influence of any other
 49    drug  or any combination of alcohol and any drug to a degree which renders him
 50    incapable of safely operating a vessel to operate or  be  in  actual  physical

Statement of Purpose / Fiscal Impact



                STATEMENT OF PURPOSE

                     RS 09401C1

     The department of law enforcement has significantly reorganized to achieve
     efficiencies in service and a more effective agency. This proposal amends
     multiple sections of Idaho Code to change the agency name to the Idaho state
     police; change references to the director of the department of law enforcement to
     the director of the Idaho state police; delete language referring to the Idaho state
     police division; delete language referring to the police services division and the
     alcohol beverage control division as distinct budget divisions; change the
     administrator of the Idaho state police to the superintendent of the Idaho state
     police; and remove any redundant language referring to "investigators of the
     department of law enforcement" when the Idaho state police is already
     mentioned     in    the     section    being      amended.



                     FISCAL NOTE

          Fiscal impact of this proposal is in two areas. The name change associated
     with the reorganization requires new signage at DLE locations; new letterhead
     and business cards agency-wide; and new logos and flags at locations formerly
     displaying department of law enforcement logos and flags.     The cost of these
     changes is approximately $18,500 and is being funded from the FY2000 budget.
          In terms of the budget structure, while agency reorganization has
     eliminated the former budget divisions of alcohol beverage control and Idaho state
     police, these functions still exist and are budgeted at the program level.     There is
     no ongoing fiscal impact   associated     with     the     agency     reorganization.
