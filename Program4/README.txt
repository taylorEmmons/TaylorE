How does each program work?:

The ProcessText program creates a new TextStatistics object and passes in a file source from the commandline.
The TextStatistics object then breaks the file into lines, words and characters and counts each.

What error testing do you perform?:

One error I got was the number of lines returned kept being one less than it should have been. The 
Reason was because my loop counting started counting at 0.



What improvements could be made to this program?:

An improvement I did make and commented out was looping through the resources folder I created and it gets the "TextStatistics" of 
each of those files.
